To get the materials: 

1. Easiest. Just clone the repo ``git clone https://github.com/UPPMAX/HPC-python.git``. The ``Lessons`` directory is below the ``HPC-python`` directory that is created when you clone the repo. 

2. Otherwise, fetch the tarball from the project directory (during the course) and extract it with "tar xzvf Exercises.tar.gz"
   - UPPMAX: Copy the file ``/proj/hpc-python/Exercises.tar.gz`` to your own project storage directory below ``/proj/hpc-python``. 
   - HPC2N: Copy the file ``/proj/nobackup/python-hpc/Exercises.tar.gz`` to your own storage directory below ``/proj/nobackup/ipython-hpc``.

The directories below "Exercises/examples" contains the following directories:

- programs: Python codes, mainly, as well as a few Fortran and Julia codes
- hpc2n: Batch scripts that can run on Kebnekaise when you have edited the MYPATH variable inside (since the Python scripts recides in the programs directory)
- uppmax: same as above, but for UPPMAX (Rackham mainly)
